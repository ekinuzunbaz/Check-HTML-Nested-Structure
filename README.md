# Check-HTML-Nested-Structure
This Java program checks the correct nesting of HTML elements within a given string. It utilizes a stack to keep track of opening and closing HTML tags and determines whether they are nested correctly.

## Explanation
* Utilizing a stack to manage opening and closing tags, the program iterates through the input string, identifying and processing each tag.
* If the nesting is accurate, it returns "true"; otherwise, it pinpoints the first incorrectly nested element. 
* Users can interact with the program by entering an HTML string, and it promptly provides feedback on the correctness of element nesting or highlights the first element that breaks the correct nesting sequence.
